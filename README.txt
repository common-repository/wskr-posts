Bring the power of WSKR to WordPress. Turn your posts into premium content and generate pay-per-article revenue.

== Description ==

WSKR is a revenue generation tool like no other. 

The WSKR Posts plugin for WordPress enables you to generate revenue from individual posts. Working in tandem with your [WSKR Business account](https://business.wskr.ie), you can tag individual posts for use with the WSKR Posts plugin turning them into a pay-per-article revenue model. No longer limited to needing subscriptions or adverts on your pages to generate revenue, you can now convert non-paying website visitors into paying customers.

WSKR is 100% free for businesses as we don’t charge commission, transaction or credit card fees on our Business accounts, so you can sign up and see if WSKR works for you, without fear of spending money on a plugin that doesn’t quite suit your needs.

You can register for your free [WSKR Business account](https://business.wskr.ie) and connect it to your plugin in the settings page.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Why was WSKR created? =

To provide an additional revenue stream to content creators and those that host content, through a pay-per-click or pay-per-article revenue model. And to improve the browsing experience for end-users by providing a revenue generating mechanism that does not require adverts or subscriptions. 

= How do I sign up for WSKR? =

You can sign up for a Business account [here](https://business.wskr.ie/Identity/Account/Register). WSKR Business accounts are 100% free.

= Why do I need a Revolut account to get paid? =

Since WSKR is intended to be free to use for businesses, we had to find a way to transfer funds to businesses without incurring any costs. Revolut provides this functionality by allowing Revolut-to-Revolut account transfers, free of charge.

= How does WSKR generate its own revenue? =

WSKR is unique among online platforms. We do not charge businesses any transaction, setup, or credit card fees. Instead, the cost of running WSKR is paid by the end-user. We accomplish this through the use of WSKR Tokens, which end-users buy and then use to pay for content.

= Do people need a WSKR account to view my WSKR content? =

Yes, they need a WSKR Personal account which they can sign up for [here](https://my.wskr.ie/identity/account/register).
